    <h1>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Visualization</h1>
    <p>This visualization displays the real-time interaction of multiple agents within an environment. Agents learn to achieve goals through reinforcement learning, with their performance evaluated based on accumulated rewards and task completion. The process involves agents observing the environment, taking actions, and updating their policies based on feedback.</p>
    <p>In this visualization, blue squares represent the agents, which are the active entities learning to navigate and interact. Green squares represent the targets, which the agents aim to collect to receive rewards and complete their objectives.</p>
    <p>Upon successful execution, this web visualization demo provides real-time insights into the dynamic interactions within multi-agent systems. It allows for observation of emergent behaviors, evaluation of agent strategies, and a deeper understanding of how reinforcement learning algorithms drive collective intelligence in complex environments.</p>
